AntiCheatAddition for free
Literally just AntiCheatAddition plugin for free. If you don't know how to install plugins I'll explain. 
First, see if you have a "Vanilla" server, which means its default. If you have that, change it to paper or spigot. I recommend paper. https://papermc.io/downloads or if you use a server hosting website you can just change it there. Then restart the server, open the server file, and check if you have a "plugins" folder. If not, make a folder called "plugins" then put the .jar file you get here into the folder, and restart the server. Or just look it up. Idk.
